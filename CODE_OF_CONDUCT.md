# Code of Conduct

This is the code of conduct for the **IntenseRP Next** project. Here, the main points and expectations are outlined so that everyone can contribute in a positive and constructive manner. Though, don't get it the wrong way, we aren't that strict, but we do expect some basic standards to be followed. Let's keep it simple and straightforward, just like the project itself.

## The Basic Idea

IntenseRP Next is a technical project built for the SillyTavern community. We're here to make AI integration better and more reliable, not to create drama or conflict. This code of conduct is about keeping things professional and helpful.

## What We Expect

**Be helpful**: If someone's stuck with a bug or needs help understanding the code, lend a hand. We've all been there.

**Be direct**: Technical discussions work best when they're clear. If something's broken, say so. If you disagree with an approach, explain why, we appreciate constructive feedback or suggestions.

**Be patient**: Not everyone knows Python, browser automation, or API design. Take the time to explain things if you can.

**Stay on topic**: Albeit this is a technical project, we still want to keep discussions relevant. If you have a general question about SillyTavern or DeepSeek AI, ask it in the right place.

## What We Don't Want

**Don't be a jerk**: Basic respect goes a long way. No harassment, personal attacks, or toxic behavior.

**Don't spam**: Keep issues focused on actual problems. Don't flood the repo with duplicate reports or off-topic discussions.

**Don't break things intentionally**: This includes malicious code, security vulnerabilities, or anything that could harm users.

**Don't derail discussions**: If maintainers are trying to fix a critical bug, that's not the time to argue about code style preferences.

## How We Handle Issues

**Minor stuff**: If someone's having a bad day and gets a bit aggressive, we'll try to resolve it privately. A simple reminder about the code of conduct usually does the trick.

**Bigger problems**: Repeated harassment, malicious behavior, or anything that makes contributors uncomfortable gets addressed directly. This might mean temporary or permanent removal from the project.

**Appeals**: If you think we got something wrong, reach out to the maintainers. We're human and make mistakes too.

## Reporting Problems

If someone's behavior is making the project worse for everyone:

1. **Direct issues**: Try talking to them first if it's safe to do so
2. **Serious issues**: Contact the maintainers directly through GitHub or email
3. **Urgent issues**: For anything involving harassment or threats, contact us immediately

## The Technical Side

This project deals with browser automation, API integration, and AI services. Mainly it's the usual stuff as in any other open-source project:

- **Test your changes**: Don't submit broken code
- **Document what you're doing**: Especially for complex features
- **Follow the existing patterns**: Look at how the current code works
- **Be honest about what you don't know**: It's better to ask than to guess

## Bottom Line

We're building something useful for the SillyTavern community, and we want to keep it that way. This code of conduct is about making sure everyone feels welcome and can contribute without drama. If you have questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to the maintainers.
